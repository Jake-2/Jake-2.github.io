		<h1>About me, Jake</h1>
			

		<p>Hello, my name is Jake.</p>

		
		<h2>Hobbies</h2> 

		<p>I have a lot of hobbies, I really love sports and video games. Some video games I like are, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home"> fortnite</a>, <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/index.aspx">rainbow six siege</a>, <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">overwatch</a> , and <strong>many</strong> more games. I think video games are really fun because they can be a break from all the stressful stuff. Its a time to have fun in a different world. Even though I play a <strong>lot</strong> of video games I still really do love sports. When I was younger I played a lot of baseball and some times soccer. Eventually I grew out of baseball and started to play a lot more soccer, and I started playing soccer competetivly. I started to play more waterpolo in the summer since there was no soccer. </p>

		<h2>Asthma</h2>

		<p>One day relized I found out I had <a href="https://www.webmd.com/asthma/default.htm">asthma</a>. Asthma was pretty hard for me because I loved sports, in sports it was hard to breathe some times. I went to the docter a lot. I would get more inhailers. I would use these everytime before I played sports, and they really helped. </p>
